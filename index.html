              Ralph is a total bad ass.  I was blown away by how quickly he did things and how I didn’t have to know any of the technical details.  he just handled it all for me. So grateful to have his support on my side.

           There are 4 core elements to what I do...
          </p>
        
          <ol class="intro-p bullet-points mb">
              <li>Development</li>
              <li>Design</li>
              <li>Marketing</li>
              <li>Analytics</li>
          </ol>

          <p class="mb intro-p">
              <b>1. Let's start with development;</b> I'm a Full-stack software engineer by trade, the workflow and tools I use are <b>way</b> too many to list in this brief intro, so I devoted an entire "Tech Stack" section at the bottom of this page to go over the technical details.
              <br><br>
               But the high-level is: LAMP/LEMP stack with MYSQL / PHP / LARAVEL / HTML / JS / VUE.JS / JQUERY / WORDPRESSS
          </p>

          <p class="mb intro-p">
              <b>2. Design;</b> By that I mean more than just "having an eye for design"... I used to design full-time and have extensive experience. I saw projects come to life through the full design cycle, from pen and paper, to rough wire-frames, to high-fedility PSDs, and to living breathing (mobile-optimized) web pages. 
              <br><br>
              I also created multiple logos and worked on branding campagins. (Although, I'll say that this area isn't my biggest focus right now, I just list it here because aesthetic design will always be a core component of anything I create -- I can even share my Behance portfolio with you if you promise to keep it our secret).
          </p>

          <p class="mb intro-p">  
            <b>3. Marketing....</b> This is probably the most over-used term today. It seems that everyone out there is a marketing guru, I don't claim to be a guru myself, but I'll tell you this, I've built and consulted on funnels that generated millions of dollars in revenue. I optimized them, closely monitored them, tweaked them, and judged my performance only by cold and hard numbers.
            <br><br>
            The botom line is: I consider myself a true student of direct marketing, and I have the experience and knowledge to back it up.
          </p>

          <p class="mb intro-p">
              <b>4. Analytics;</b>
              The feedback loop goes like this... <br>Produce >> Analyze feedback and data >> Improve and adjust course >> Repeat.
              <br><br>
              I found that companies with the shortest feedback loop always win and grow the fastest.
              <br><br>
              Analytics and data are at the heart of all decisions, and I leveraged (and technically integrated) at least a dozen of analytics software.. mixpanel, kissmetrics and google analytics to name a few.
              <br><br>
              This could potentialy be the most vital (and toughest) element of the all the above, it takes a lot of discipline to track, measure, and be quick to adjust.
          </p>

          <h2><b>What am I looking for?</b></h2>
          <br>

          <p class="mb intro-p">
              I'm blessed to have my skillset in this day and age.. I'm a mix of developer/designer/marketer who lives in a time where everyone is glued to a screen, there's no lack of opportunity for my skillset out there, there's simply high-demand for what I do right now.
          </p>

          <p class="mb intro-p">
             But not all work is the same. Here's what I <b>really</b> want.....
          </p>

          <p class="mb intro-p">
            <b>To work with great people!</b>
          </p>

          <p class="mb intro-p">
            Work interactions make up the MAJORITY of our interactions day to day, and all I want is to spend those interactions with people that I enjoy working with. 
          </p>

          <p class="mb intro-p">
              So yeah.. the bottom line is; I wanna work with awesome, smart, and talented people, because life is just too short :-)
          </p>

          <p class="mb intro-p">
            If you're that kind of kickass company or team, please hit me back at ralph@ralph-benjamin.net I'd love to have a chat with you.

          <h1 class="mb"># Tech Stack</h1>

          <p class="mb intro-p">
            <b>Front-end:</b> Bootstrap / HTML / CSS / LESS / SCSS / Javascript / jQuery / Vue.js / Angular.js (strong preference for Vue.js over Angular.js)
            <br><br>

            <b>Back-end:</b> PHP / MYSQL / Laravel / WordPress
            <br><br>

            <b>Dev Enviroment:</b> OS X, running Vagrant Homestead VM (I used to use Ubuntu full-time before I switched to mac, I strictly use Linux only for development and live in the command line)
            <br><br>

            <b>Workflow tools/plugins/package managers:</b> Sublime text (w/ emmet) / nano / Git / Yeoman / Composer / Bower / Gulp.js / iTerm / Z shell / Sequel Pro
            <br><br>

            <b>Server providers & Deployment:</b> Amazon AWS / Digital Ocean / Vultr / Laravel Forge. (I used a ton of various server providers over the years, and anything other than the above is waste of time and money)
            <br><br>

            <b>Version control:</b> I never work without Git, and use both Bitbucket/Github
            <br><br>

            <b>APIs:</b> I built my own RESTful APIs, and wrote code to consume just about every kind out there.. payment integrations / marketing tools integrations / CRMs / custom middle-man 3-way APIs (that connect services not officially supported to work together etc)… you name it.
            <br><br>

            <b>Real-time networks:</b> Pusher & PubNub
            <br><br>

            <b>Didn't see something you hoped was on the list?</b> Get in touch, I may have used it and not forgot it here.
            <br><br>
